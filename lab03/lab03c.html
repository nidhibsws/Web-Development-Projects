            <p>bootstrap is a framework used for responsive faster and easier way of developing a webpage unlike using CSS media queries and viewport to implement a fluid response. Comparing to that,bootstrap saves time in numerous ways by preventing repetitions of navbars,labels and etc and it makes design more responsive that can be adapted to different sizes of screens and we can choose what to show on different devices.
            </p>

            <p>so according to me,i think using bootstrap framwork is easier and the best</p>
